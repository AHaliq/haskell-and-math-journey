# Down the Haskell Rabbithole
*and other math adventures*

---

# DISCLAIMER
a brief tour from a hobbyist, not an expert...

---

## First Impressions of Haskell

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
main :: IO()
main = putStrLn "Hello Dathena"
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### The Gotchas

Everything is pure. immutable

*why are variables weird? I cant mutate variables*

---

### The Gotchas

No imperative and procedural code

how do i iterate? theres no loops

---

### The Gotchas

Side effects are wrapped in monads. The only exception from purity.

*how do i print debug statements? whats an `IO` monad?*

---

### Nonogram Solver

---

### DEMO

---

### What I've learnt

* Data flow rather (functional) vs Message Passing (OOP)
* think in terms of recursions

---

### Example in code

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell 5[5:9],6[9:11],7[9:14],8[9:13],9[13:15],10[13:15],11[13:17],12[17:19],13[17:19],14
genseq :: Int -> [Int] -> [(Range,[Range])] -> [[HRT]]
genseq _ [] par = if (foldl (+) 0 $ map (\(_,rs)-> length rs) par) == 0 then [[]] else []
-- if no hints; and no O ranges blank is an ordering
genseq b h par =
    foldl (++) [] $                                     -- collate all possible O pull
        map (\x -> ordPart $ zip x par) $               -- each order's possible O pull
        filter (validOW ps) $                           -- filter violate X / cant fit
        foldl (++) [] $                                 -- collate possible ordering
            map (\x -> ordhg [] (length x) x pc) $      -- divpts hint groups in partitions; order
            map (divhin 0 h) $                          -- hints in groups defined by division points
            foldl (++) [] $                             -- collate list of division points
                map (\x -> snd(divpts (length h) x)) $  -- divpts division points
                map (\x -> [1..x]) $                    -- initial group division point for hint list
                [0..((min pc (length h))-1)]            -- division point index
    where
        ps = map (fst) par
        pc = (length ps)
```

</CodeSurfer>

### New Powers

Recursive Types, Parametric Polymorphism, Algebraic Data Types

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)

example :: List Int
example = Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 Empty))
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### New Powers

Currying and first class functions


<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
myFunc :: a -> a -> a
myFunc a b = a + b

fiveAdder = myFunc 5

example = fiveAdder 3
-- 8
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### New Powers

Pattern matching


<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
f [] = 34
f [x] = x + x
f (a:b:xs) = a * b

example1 = f []       -- 34
example2 = f [1]      -- 2
example3 = f [3,4]    -- 12
example4 = f [1,2,3]  -- 2
```

</CodeSurfer>

---
### New Powers

Lazy evaluation; we can have infinite structures

<CodeSurfer>

```haskell
let fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
let example = take 10 fibs
-- [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

</CodeSurfer>

## So I got confident in haskell but theres more
* Lenses / Optics library
* FRP paradigm with arrows
* Math jargons used

---

### A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors
*whats the problem?*

---

## Category Theory

---

### Segue to Set Theory

* Numbers - Integers, Rationals, Reals, Complex
* Order (relations) - equivalence classes, posets, lattices, ...
* Algebraic (functions) - Groups, Monoids, Magma, Rings, Vector Space, ...
* Subset - Topology, Sigma Algebra, Borel Algebra, ...

Can all mathematical structure be organized hierarchically? (e.g. construction from sets)

### Theoretical Computer Science & PLT

Philosophy of formalism says math is a formal language
* A set of symbols and based on rules form well formed formulas

### My goals

* Understand the Lambek in the C-H-L holy trinity
* Understand HoTT as a new foundation of math and computation

---

### My goals

* Gain new ways of thinking
* Learn cutting edge PLs
  * Linear logic for concurrent programming
  * Modal Logic for ???
  * Temporal Logic for ???
